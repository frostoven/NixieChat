Contains utils for working with cryptographic functions.

For anyone wanting to get into this, please make sure you take the time to
properly research cryptography, and the methods used here. It's very easy to
take highly secure functions and combine them in ways that make the overall
application horribly insecure.

Cryptography is not easy to get right, and each function has weird subtleties
you'll need to be aware of before using.
